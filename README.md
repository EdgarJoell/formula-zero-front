# Formula Zero (Front-End)
Link to Back-End repo: https://github.com/EdgarJoell/formula-zero-back

## Description
The purpose of the Formula Zero application is to provide a service to Formula 1 (F1) fans the opportunity to purchase a Formula Zero Experience which will allow F1 fans to have the once-in-a-lifetime experience to drive the race car that their favorite F1 driver will be racing with. I know I would absolutely love to drive the car of Max Verstappen of the Red Bull Racing team or Lewis Hamilton's car of Mercedes.

## Approach
When it came to approach, I knew I was going to have fun making this project because I love Formula 1 races but I was a bit worried since it would be my first Full-Stack application. Then from there, mny approach was to write the front-end one page at a time and access back-end information when needed.

One major hurdle I had to overcome was how to access information from the back-end and then projecting it to the front-end web page. This was difficult for me since I didn't know how to access the information correctly which was resulting in the information not displaying on the page at all. When it came to learning how to do this correctly, I received some help from my peers who were able to guide and describe to me what to do, what was happening with the code, and why.

## Self Review
I am very proud of the application that I put together in just about a week. I was able to push myself, gain a better understanding of Angular and Http requests, as well as making components, modules, and routing for the page to navigate. For future additions, I would love to have a login/register feature and be able to save all the information like regular websites do.
